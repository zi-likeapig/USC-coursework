# EE538 Midterm Exam 

## University of Southern California

## Instructor: Arash Saifhashemi

## Important:

- A lot of time and effort has been spent to design this exam for you. Please use this as a great learning opportunity and take this exam seriously.
- Please make sure you abide by the academic integrity rules and only submit your original work. All the rules described in Q1 of the Gradescope exam applies here as well.
- Make sure you use address sanitizer! (Use --config=asan with your bazel test commands.)
- Every time that you use a dereferencing operator (* or ->) make sure your pointer is valid!

Also note that:

- Important: Don't modify the header files. Your implementation should go in .cc files.
- Please find each question in a separate folder under [files](/files).
- For coding questions, edit the files and check them in.
- Writing student tests is optional. Your code must pass grader test.
- For your convenience the grader tests are provided in this repo and you can run them locally.
- For submission, please push your answers to Github before the deadline.

| Question | Points |
| -------- | ------ |
| 1        | 15     |
| 2        | 20     |
| 3        | 20     |
| 4        | 20     |
| 5        | 20     |

- Getting 100 points from the sum of the points in this repo plus the points in Gradescope exam is considered full credit.
- - For example, if you get 80 from this repo and 25 from Gradescope, your total would be 105, which means you received full credit!
