# EE538 Final Exam

## University of Southern California

## Instructor: Arash Saifhashemi

## Important:
- **Commit Limit:** You are allowed a maximum of 5 commits (not counting the initial setup commit from GitHub). Each additional commit beyond this limit will result in a 10-point deduction.
- Please make sure you abide by the academic integrity rules and only submit your original work. All the rules described in Q1 of the Gradescope exam applies here as well.
- **DO NOT** modify the header files. Your implementation should go in .cc files. Make sure that all necessary header files are included in your submission.
- Please find each question in a separate folder under [files](/files). For coding questions, edit the files and check them in. Push your commits to Github before the deadline.
- Code snippets that cause test cases to be bypassed will result in severe points deduction.
- Make sure you use address sanitizer!
- This repo is using C++20. Make sure your machine has the latest version of C++ compiler and C++20 is supported.
- Make sure there is no memory misuse.


| Question | Points |
| -------- | ------ |
| 1        | 30     |
| 2        | 20     |
| 3        | 30     |

- Getting 100 points from the sum of the points in this repo plus the points in Gradescope exam is considered full credit.
  - For example, if you get 80 from this repo and 25 from Gradescope, your total would be 105, which means you received full credit!
